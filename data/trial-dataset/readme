***** Task Descripton ***** 

The Lexical Simplification task consists in ranking a list of near synonyms that have been deemed to fit a context *in an ascending order of complexity* (i.e. simplest first). This judgement should be based on the context as opposed to the near symonyms alone: how commonly a word is used in a particular sense in the given context.  Ties are allowed to indicate words with similar level of difficulty. 

For instance, take the following example where ‘intelligent’ has been deemed to be the simplest option, followed by ‘clever’, followed by a tie between ‘smart’ and ‘bright’:
"During the siege , George Robertson had appointed Shuja-ul-Mulk , who was a _____ boy only 12 years old and the youngest surviving son of Aman-ul-Mulk , as the ruler of Chitral ."

Substitutes: intelligent; bright; clever; smart
Gold-ranking: {intelligent}; {clever}; {bright, smart}
