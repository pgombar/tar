# Lexical text simplification
Project work for the course [Text Analysis and Retrieval](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/apt) at University of Zagreb.

# Task description
For non-native speakers, people with low literacy or intellectual disabilities, and language-impaired
people (e.g., autistic, aphasic, congenitally deaf), regular texts (e.g., news) are
often difficult to comprehend. Stylistically decorated sentences utilizing sophisticated
vocabulary of infrequent words pose a particular difficulty for these groups of people. The
goal of this project is to build a system for lexical simplification of text. Such a system
should replace complex and hard-to-comprehend words with less complex semantically-matching words (e.g., “to leverage scarce resources” -> “to use rare resources”).
